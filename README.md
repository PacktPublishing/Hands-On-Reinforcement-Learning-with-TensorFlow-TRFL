# Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow & TRFL [Video]
This is the code repository for [Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow & TRFL [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/reinforcement-learning-tensorflow-trfl-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789950748), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The TRFL library is a collection of key algorithmic components that are used for a large number of DeepMind agents such as DQN, DDPG, and the Importance of Weighted Actor Learner Architecture. With this course, you will learn to implement classical RL algorithms as well as other cutting-edge techniques. 
This course will help you get up-to-speed with the TRFL library quickly, so you can start building your own RL agents. Without wasting much time on theory, the course dives straightaway into designing and implementing RL algorithms. 
By the end, you will be quite familiar with the tool and will be ready to put your knowledge into practice in your own projects.
